## Prior Arts

Inspired by [Browser Storage Abuser](https://demo.agektmr.com/storage/) and [Browser database comparison](http://nolanlawson.github.io/database-comparison/).

Browser storage abuser unfortunately no longer works in the modern browsers. We provide more benchmarks to represent real world use cases.
